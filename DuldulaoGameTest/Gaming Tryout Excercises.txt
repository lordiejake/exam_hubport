Mobile Fun Coding Challenge
Create the following game:

You have a set of warriors, each warrior has the following data:
? Name
? Health
? Attack
? Defence
? Speed
? Evade

Health, Attack, Defence and Speed are integer values between 0 and 100. Evade is a
number between 0 and 1.

There are currently 3 types of warrior:
? Ninja
? Health (40-60)
? Attack (60-70)
? Defence (20-30)
? Speed (90-100)
? Evade (0.3-0.5)

? Samurai
? Health (60-100)
? Attack (75-80)
? Defence (35-40)
? Speed (60-80)
? Evade (0.3-0.4)

? Brawler
? Health (90-100)
? Attack (65-75)
? Defence (40-50)
? Speed (40-65)
? Evade (0.3-0.35)

The values for each attribute are specified as a range, on creation each warrior will be
assigned a random value within this range for the given attribute.

Warriors can take part in a battle, a battle has only 2 combatants. Warriors take it in turn to
attack each other. The warrior with the greatest speed takes the first attack (in the event of
two with the same speed, player with the lower defence goes first).

1:   The damage dealt is (attack - oppositions defence) and is taken from the health. 


2:   Damage may be avoided, the chance of avoiding an attack is specified by the evade attribute.

The max amount of turns is 30 per player, if no player is defeated then the battle is a draw.
As the battle progresses a text output should be shown. When a warrior gets to zero health
the warrior is defeated.

Special attributes of warriors:
? Ninja
With each attack there is a 5% chance of doubling the attack strength.

? Samurai
When a samurai evades an attack there is a 10% chance of regaining 10 health.

? +Brawler
? When a brawler’s health falls to less than 20% their defence increases by 10.

Allow a form to select player 1 and 2, and when submitted create a battle with the 2 players
and output the result of the battle!!
